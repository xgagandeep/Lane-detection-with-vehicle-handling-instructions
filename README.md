# Lane Detection üõ£Ô∏è

**Project:** Lane Detection  
**Date:** 2016  
**Language:** Processing (Java-based)  
**Libraries:** OpenCV, Processing Video  
**Type:** Computer Vision Project for Lane Detection

## Overview

This project demonstrates a lane detection system using video footage and the OpenCV library. The program identifies the left and right lanes of the road using Hough line detection and linear regression to find the best-fit lines. The detected lanes are then analyzed to compute the vehicle's distance from the center and provide driving suggestions (e.g., "Turn Left," "Turn Right," or "Go Straight").

## Features

- **Lane Detection:** Identifies and draws the longest left and right lanes in the video.
- **Linear Regression:** Computes the best-fit lines for each lane using linear regression.
- **Distance Calculation:** Calculates the vehicle‚Äôs distance from the center of the road.
- **Driving Guidance:** Provides visual cues for turning left, right, or continuing straight based on the lane positions.
- **Background Video:** Plays the input video in the background while lane detection is performed.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/lane-detection.git
   cd lane-detection
   ```

2. Download and install [Processing](https://processing.org/download/).

3. Install the required libraries in Processing:
   - [OpenCV](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing)
   - Processing Video library

4. Open the `Lane_detection.pde` file in Processing.

5. Run the project. The program will play the video and display the detected lanes along with driving guidance.

6. Pause or resume the video playback by clicking the mouse.

## Requirements

- Processing IDE
- OpenCV for Processing
- Processing Video Library
- A compatible video file (included in the project as `d.mp4`)

## About

This lane detection project was originally completed in 2016. It showcases computer vision techniques, specifically edge detection and Hough line transformation, to detect lanes in a video stream. I am moving this project from an older repository to this one for better management.
